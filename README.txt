We read two columns from an excel file.
Combine those strings and parse it in a way that google understands it. (URL parsing & quoting it)
We do a usual requests to google with that URL.

We get all the Heading tags. And if relevant keep it in a notepad or else pass.

Note: Check for the initial div class to strip the links google changes tags periodically
